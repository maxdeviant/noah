A friendly dictionary library.

##Building

`python generate.py` to generate the working dictionary file.

`python api.py` to start the API endpoint.

##TODO

The most pressing issue right now is to come up with a robust dictionary for Noah to reference.

Currently generating the dictionary from the `2of12id` dictionary from [kevina/wordlist](https://github.com/kevina/wordlist). It works for the most part, other than the outlying elements (found in the `dump` property) and no way of telling adjectives and adverbs apart.
